Overview

I built a Vanilla JavaScript weather app in SheCodes Plus, an advanced 8-week JavaScript coding workshop. Building upon my previously-gained knowledge, I also became skilled in Bootstrap, APIâ€™s, real-life development workflow, hosting, and advanced JavaScript. I combined all of these skills to create a fully-functioning weather app.

This project is a simple, interactive weather forecast application designed to provide real-time weather information. It uses basic HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface and vanilla JavaScript to fetch and display weather data dynamically. The app leverages an external API, to retrieve accurate weather information for user-specified locations.

Clean Aesthetics: Styled with modern CSS to present weather details in an engaging and intuitive way.
